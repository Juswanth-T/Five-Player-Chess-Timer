# Synchronized Timer System for 5-Player Chess  

Welcome to the Synchronized Timer System for 5-Player Chess! This project provides a specialized timer system designed specifically for 5-player chess games.The timer system allows a single person, who is not part of the game, to control the timers seamlessly, ensuring a smooth flow of the game without any delays between moves of players.

 ## Features  
 
-  **Synchronized Timers**: The timer system provides synchronized timers for each player in a 5-player chess game. This ensures fair play and efficient turn management, allowing players to stay on track during their allotted time.

-  **Single Controller**: A single person (who is not part of the game), acting as the timer controller, can manage and control all the timers. This allows for centralized time management, eliminating the need for each player to have their control.
  
-  **Customization Options**: The timer system offers various customization options to adapt to different game scenarios. Controller can permanently delete a timer if a player is eliminated or customize timers by adding or deducting time when necessary.
